  <article class="post-content">
    <p class="post-paragraph">Knowledge professionals are always in a continuous effort to be up to date about best practices and innovations in their field. Even content not directly related is useful to maintain a consistent view of the world. The podcast ecosystem has exploded in the last years and can be one, if not the primary, source of convenient and useful content.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">I've been curating a dynamic list of shows that I use for self-education and entertainment. Maybe part of that playlist can be useful to you. I subscribe to more than what is sharer here, but I limited myself to the ones that I am most confident about production quality and relevance.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">The podcasts are grouped into three categories: those about tech in general, the ones on web development, and some that are not directly tech-related but could be relevant to folks on the field.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Here we go.</p>
<h2 class="post-subtitle">Tech</h2>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://changelog.com/"><strong>Changelog</strong></a> is a news website for developers. They publish a variety of podcasts going from <a href="https://changelog.com/jsparty">JavaScript</a> to <a href="https://changelog.com/practicalai">AI</a>, with even a show about <a href="https://changelog.com/brainscience">brain science</a>. I recommend their <a href="https://changelog.com/master">master feed</a> to get all shows as they come by.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://changelog.com/master"><strong>Fullstack Stack Radio</strong></a> is hosted by Adam Wathan (the creator of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a>). In every episode, he interviews a guest exploring some developer subject. The show is broad in theme choices. You will find stuff like product management or selling digital products. Adam is a strong host, always curious and trying to go deep in the subject.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://www.programmingthrowdown.com/"><strong>Programming Throwdown</strong></a> lunches episodes monthly. The host has an analytical angle, exposing aspects not explored even in exhaustly covered subjects. The <a href="https://www.programmingthrowdown.com/2020/05/episode-101-reactjs-with-guillermo-rauch.html">ReactJS episode</a> is an excellent example.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://twit.tv/"><strong>Twit</strong></a> is a network with dozens of tech shows. They have a high production value, and everything is very professional. I recommend their flagship program: <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>. It is a weekly panel with journalists and professionals dissecting the tech news. The host, Leo Laporte, is fantastic. I enjoy him as much as the content.</p>
<h2 class="post-subtitle">Web Development</h2>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/"><strong>Front End Happy Hour</strong></a> puts together a panel with a peculiar premise. They choose a word that, when spoken during the show, forces everyone to take a shot. I love it 🍹. The podcast clearly has some black belt developers from companies like Netflix and Atlassian.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://syntax.fm/"><strong>Syntax</strong></a> is hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. To me, they seem like professionals hardened by a lot of freelancing experience. They go to the point fast and always give tips with practical application. Some episodes are even exclusive to address audience questions.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="http://thestateoftheweb.googledevelopers.libsynpro.com/"><strong>The State of the Web</strong></a> is a Google production that explores web trends like service workers, CSS, or accessibility, showing what is new or yet to come to browsers.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://news.vuejs.org/"><strong>Vue.js News</strong></a>. As an aspiring Vue programmer, I am always searching for Vue podcasts. Even not able to say I found the killer one, Vue.js News is a good choice to keep in touch with the most important Vue stories around the web.</p>
<h2 class="post-subtitle">Great Options</h2>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://a16z.com/"><strong>a16z</strong></a> is a venture capital firm tied with the code industry. Their <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts/">podcast</a> explore cutting edge trends. It is a good option to anticipate where Silicon Valley is pointed to.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/04/podcast-cold-call"><strong>Cold Call</strong></a> is a podcast from Harvard Business Review exposing a case study every episode. Case studies are a traditional teaching methodology at Harvard Business School. It is a content form very suitable for storytelling, which makes some events a pleasure entertainment.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="https://freakonomics.com/archive/"><strong>Freaknomics Radio</strong></a> is produced by a co-author of the iconic Freakonomics books. Like in the books, they explore subjects not obviously tied to the economics field. Nevertheless, they apply a rigorous economic methodology to achieve exciting and sometimes controversial conclusions.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><a href="http://blogs.wgbh.org/innovation-hub/"><strong>Innovation Hub</strong></a> is a scientific analysis of very present life challenges like product design or housing costs. All episodes have some scientist guests, and the content is supported by research.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">I don't know about you, but sometimes I get guilt feelings by not being able to listen to everything I subscribe to 😔. I had the same problem with my RSS feed in the past. I'm sure I'm crazy 🤪, but do you ever fell like that?</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">I developed a system that does deal with that. The first thing is to sanitize the subscription list as much as I can. Second, set up the podcast app to only keep the last episode of every show. And last, I started to force on me, a view that the playlist is more like a stream of content (as a twitter feed) than a to-do backlog.</p>
