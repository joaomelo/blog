To keep any career going is super important to be updated about best pratices, lessons learned by the community of specialists and innovations on the field. Even non directly related content can be usefull to form a broader view of the world.

The podcast ecosystem has exploded in the last years and can be one, if not, the major source of tecnical content. I've been curating a dynamic list of shows both from the podcast and YouTube that i use as source of continuos developmenet since they can couple well together with daily activities.

Maybe some of that playlist can be useful to you. They gravitate aournd web develoment but i putted some indiretect content that i find of high quality to any audience. They are list below order alphabetically.

I listen to a lot more, but a tryed to keep on the shows i recommend with confdance.

## Tech in General

[**Changelog**](https://changelog.com/) is a news and podcast website for developers. They have a variety of shows going from [JavaScript](https://changelog.com/jsparty) to [AI](https://changelog.com/practicalai), with even a podcast about [brain science](https://changelog.com/brainscience). I recommend subscribe to their [master feed](https://changelog.com/master) to get all shows as they come by.

[**Fullstack Stack Radio**](https://changelog.com/master) is a podcast were host Adam Wathan (also the creator of [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework) interviews a guest talking about some developer subject. The show not limits itself from talking about stuff like product management or best ways to sell a digital product. He is a string host, always curious and trying to go deep in the subject.

[**Twit**](https://twit.tv/) is network of dozens of shows about tech. They have a high production value and every if very professional. I recommend they flagship program: [This Week in Tech](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech). It is a weekly panel analyzing the tech news. The Host, Leo Laporte, creates a very relaxed environment. I enjoy his conduction as much as the content.

[**Programming Throwdown**](https://www.programmingthrowdown.com/) lunches episodes about one by month. I like the ways subsjects are analysided. I think the hosts tend to aprroach temes with a more deep angle, showing aspects somehow not explored even in subjects very covered in regular podcasts. 

## Web Development

[**Front End Happy Hour**](https://frontendhappyhour.com/) puts together developers to talk on a subject with a peculiar premise. They choose a word that when spoken during the show drives every to take a shot. I love it 🍹. The podcast clearly has some black belts developers from companies like Netflix and Atlassian.

[**The State of the Web**](http://thestateoftheweb.googledevelopers.libsynpro.com/) explores trends of the like service works or accessibility. The discussions soround what is new or yet to come in the technology, the episodes keep themselves short in length. 

[**Syntax**](https://syntax.fm/) is very pratical podcast. Seems to the hosts, Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, to me like professionals that did a lot of freelancing because they go to the point fast and always give tips and practical solutions. They eve have shows exclusive to address audience questions.

[**Vue.js News**](https://news.vuejs.org/) as a Vue programmer i listen to some Vue podcasts, i think i am still in search of the killer Vue show. The Vue.js News is a sute that curates rticle about Vue from the web and the podcast is a summary of the last month content. Is a good way to keep in touch of the most important thins about Vue out there.

## Other Great Options

[**a16z**](https://a16z.com/) is a venture capital form tied with the code industry. They [podcast](https://a16z.com/podcasts/) talk about cutting edge tech trends. Is a good option to catch to were everything Sillicon Valley is pointed to.

[**Cold Call**](https://hbr.org/2019/04/podcast-cold-call) is podcast from Harvard Business Review. Case studies is a traditional teach methodoly in Havard Business Scholl. Is content very suitable to story telling and becomes enterteitement medium to learn lesson from the business discipline.

[**Freaknomics Radio**](https://freakonomics.com/archive/) is a podcast from one of the co-author of the iconic Freakonomics books. Like in the books they explore subjects not bosilousy tied to the economics filed but with the same rigourous methodology achivieng interesistng conclouise, sometimes even controversous.  

[**Innovation Hub**](http://blogs.wgbh.org/innovation-hub/) give a science approach to very present subjects. They always based on research and have researches as guests to talk about stuff like product design or housing costs.

I don't know about you, but sometimes i get some guilt felling about not listeing to everything i subcribe the same felling i read with my rss read feed in the past. Do ever felt like that? 

I  developed some aprooaches do deal with that. The first thing to keep always clenaing the playlist. Second setup the podcast listener to only keep the last episode, i will politly not replace anything i alread start listening. More recently i starting colling down about that and encaring more like a stream of content as a youtube playlist or twitter feed.

So what you think about that list. Have any recommendation? Please share them with me on Twiiter.
