title: Tech Podcasts Recommendations
abstract: A curated list of tech podcasts spiced with some non-related golden choices.
--- 

Knowledge professionals are always in a continuous effort to be up to date about best practices and innovations in their field. Even content not directly related is useful to maintain a consistent view of the world. The podcast ecosystem has exploded in the last years and can be one, if not the primary, source of convenient and useful content. 

I've been curating a dynamic list of shows that I use for self-education and entertainment. Maybe part of that playlist can be useful to you. I subscribe to more than what is sharer here, but I limited myself to the ones that I am most confident about production quality and relevance. 

The podcasts are grouped into three categories: those about tech in general, the ones on web development, and some that are not directly tech-related but could be relevant to folks on the field. 

Here we go.

## Tech

[**Changelog**](https://changelog.com/) is a news website for developers. They publish a variety of podcasts going from [JavaScript](https://changelog.com/jsparty) to [AI](https://changelog.com/practicalai), with even a show about [brain science](https://changelog.com/brainscience). I recommend their [master feed](https://changelog.com/master) to get all shows as they come by.

[**Fullstack Stack Radio**](https://changelog.com/master) is hosted by Adam Wathan (the creator of [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)). In every episode, he interviews a guest exploring some developer subject. The show is broad in theme choices. You will find stuff like product management or selling digital products. Adam is a strong host, always curious and trying to go deep in the subject.

[**Programming Throwdown**](https://www.programmingthrowdown.com/) lunches episodes monthly. The host has an analytical angle, exposing aspects not explored even in exhaustly covered subjects. The [ReactJS episode](https://www.programmingthrowdown.com/2020/05/episode-101-reactjs-with-guillermo-rauch.html) is an excellent example.

[**Twit**](https://twit.tv/) is a network with dozens of tech shows. They have a high production value, and everything is very professional. I recommend their flagship program: [This Week in Tech](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech). It is a weekly panel with journalists and professionals dissecting the tech news. The host, Leo Laporte, is fantastic. I enjoy him as much as the content.

## Web Development

[**Front End Happy Hour**](https://frontendhappyhour.com/) puts together a panel with a peculiar premise. They choose a word that, when spoken during the show, forces everyone to take a shot. I love it 🍹. The podcast clearly has some black belt developers from companies like Netflix and Atlassian.

[**Syntax**](https://syntax.fm/) is hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. To me, they seem like professionals hardened by a lot of freelancing experience. They go to the point fast and always give tips with practical application. Some episodes are even exclusive to address audience questions.

[**The State of the Web**](http://thestateoftheweb.googledevelopers.libsynpro.com/) is a Google production that explores web trends like service workers, CSS, or accessibility, showing what is new or yet to come to browsers.

[**Vue.js News**](https://news.vuejs.org/). As an aspiring Vue programmer, I am always searching for Vue podcasts. Even not able to say I found the killer one, Vue.js News is a good choice to keep in touch with the most important Vue stories around the web.

## Great Options

[**a16z**](https://a16z.com/) is a venture capital firm tied with the code industry. Their [podcast](https://a16z.com/podcasts/) explore cutting edge trends. It is a good option to anticipate where Silicon Valley is pointed to.

[**Cold Call**](https://hbr.org/2019/04/podcast-cold-call) is a podcast from Harvard Business Review exposing a case study every episode. Case studies are a traditional teaching methodology at Harvard Business School. It is a content form very suitable for storytelling, which makes some events a pleasure entertainment.

[**Freaknomics Radio**](https://freakonomics.com/archive/) is produced by a co-author of the iconic Freakonomics books. Like in the books, they explore subjects not obviously tied to the economics field. Nevertheless, they apply a rigorous economic methodology to achieve exciting and sometimes controversial conclusions.  

[**Innovation Hub**](http://blogs.wgbh.org/innovation-hub/) is a scientific analysis of very present life challenges like product design or housing costs. All episodes have some scientist guests, and the content is supported by research.

I don't know about you, but sometimes I get guilt feelings by not being able to listen to everything I subscribe to 😔. I had the same problem with my RSS feed in the past. I'm sure I'm crazy 🤪, but do you ever fell like that? 

I developed a system that does deal with that. The first thing is to sanitize the subscription list as much as I can. Second, set up the podcast app to only keep the last episode of every show. And last, I started to force on me, a view that the playlist is more like a stream of content (as a twitter feed) than a to-do backlog.
